\section{Force measurements for the end-effector} % \label{app:...}

As the Endowrist tool is highly nonlinear, measurement of how the end effector responds to external force should be made. These measurements are made for the parameters estimation of the EndoWrist model.  

\subsection*{Purpose:}
The purpose is to measure the relationship between the current consumption and force acting at the end-effector. Furthermore these measurements are used in the parameter estimation for the model of the EndoWrist.

The force estimations are done on three different setups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pull/push of one clamp on the end-effector (yaw),
\item Pull/push of two clamps where the force is applied in the same direction (yaw),
\item Pull/push of the pitch on the end-effector (pitch)
\item and the rotation of the end-effector (roll).
\end{itemize}

In the following subsections the different tests defined in the itemizer above are made. For making the force measurements, item one to three, different attachment to a load-cell is made. These can be seen on \figref{fig:Overview_endowrist_attachment}.
