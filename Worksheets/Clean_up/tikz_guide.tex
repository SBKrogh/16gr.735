\subsection*{Installation of the Phantom omni}
\todo{copy some place else or erase!}
The Phantom omni can be installed on both Windows, and Linux, embedded systems. 
Use the provided installation guides on\\
\url{http://dsc.sensable.com/viewforum.php?f=15}

\textbf{Note to the linux system:} If this installation is running on a non-US version of Linux, a readout of the different joint positions can be corrupted. This is because of the difference in the EU and US compiling, where the ',' and '.' is read different.\\
To solve this problem, follow the solution given on\\
