\newglossaryentry{mat}{name={Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered}}, description={MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and fourth-generation programming language. A proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, Java, Fortran and Python.}}

\newglossaryentry{concatenate}{name={concatenate}, description={In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball"}}

\newglossaryentry{SCIP}{name={SCIP}, description={Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol is a multinational standard for secure voice and data communication. It is used for communication in land line telephone, military radios, communication satellites, Voice over IP and the several different cellular telephone standards. Therefore it was designed to make no assumptions about the underlying channel other than a minimum bandwidth of 2400 Hz\cite{SCIP2}.}}

\newglossaryentry{HASWELL}{name={Haswell}, description={Haswell is the codename for a processor microarchitecture developed by Intel as the successor to the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture. The Haswell architecture is specifically designed to optimize the power savings and performance benefits from the move to FinFET (non-planar, "3D") transistors on the improved 22 nm process node. \cite{HASWELL}.}}

\newglossaryentry{UAS}{{name={UAS}}, description={Unmaned Aircraft System is a term that covers an unmanned aircraft (UA), a ground control (GCS) / command control (C2) and the link between them. The term is therefore covering the complete system.}}
