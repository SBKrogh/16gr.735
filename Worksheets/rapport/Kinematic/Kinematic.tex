\chapter{Kinematics}\label{cha:kinematic}

From \chapref{cha:overview}, an overview of the system available on Aalborg university was introduced. In this chapter a look upon the different kinematics. This is done due to the advantages of simple calculations of the joint positions e.g Geomagic touch or the Endowrist, thus from the kinematics the velocity  and acceleration can also be derived.
