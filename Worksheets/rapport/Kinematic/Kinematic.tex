\chapter{Kinematics}\label{cha:kinematic}

From \chapref{cha:overview}, an overview of the system available on Aalborg university was introduced. In this chapter the deviation of the different kinematics are made. This is done due to the advantages of simple calculations of the joint positions e.g Geomagic touch or the Endowrist, thus from the kinematics the velocity and acceleration can also be derived.

This chapter will use the \gls{DH} notation to derive the different parameters for the kinematics. 

To use the \gls{DH} notation some rules has to be followed. 

\begin{itemize}
\item DH(1): The axis $x_n$ is perpendicular to axis $z_{n-1}$
\item DH(2): The axis $x_n$ intersects the axis $z_{n-1}$
\end{itemize}
