\chapter{System overview}\label{cha:overview}

In this chapter an description of the system is made. This is made for the reader to get a better understanding of the setup which where available on Aalborg university. This description includes the following points and will be described in the same order

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Gemagic touch
  \item The computer
  \item The test setup
  \item The Da vinci robot
\end{itemize}

\section{Geomagic touch}
The geomagic touch is a haptic feedback device, which has the ability to manipulates its joint in such a way that the user feels resistance when moving the pin in a certain direction or way. The geomagic touch described in this section is the model Phantom omni and can be seen on \figref{fig:phantom_omni}.

\end{figure}

As mentioned the Phantom omni has the ability to generate resistance for the user. In other words, when moved in a specific direction it can create a counter force in respect to a certain position. On \figref{fig:phantom_omni}, it can be seen that the omni has six degrees of freedom, where the first three has actuators. This means that the device only has the ability to generate force feedback with three degrees of freedom, in this case roll, pitch and yaw.

The connection to the omni can either be made directly through a ethernet cabel or through ethernet cabel to a usb converter into a computer. For programming the omni an API is included, which enables the connection to the omni. The programming of the omni happens through the languages C++ \note{include other languages}
