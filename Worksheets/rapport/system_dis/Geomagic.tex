\section{Geomagic touch}\label{sec:geo_magic}
The geomagic touch is a haptic feedback device, which has the ability to manipulate its joints in such a way that the user feels resistance when moving the pin in a certain direction or way. The geomagic touch described in this section is the model Phantom omni and can be seen on \figref{fig:phantom_omni}.

As mentioned the Phantom omni has the ability to generate resistance for the user. In other words, when moved in a specific direction it can create a counter force in respect to a certain position. On \figref{fig:phantom_omni}, it can be seen that the omni has six \gls{DOF}, where only the first three can be actuated, see \figref{fig:phantom1}. This means that the device only has the ability to generate force feedback with three \gls{DOF}, in this case roll, pitch and yaw.

The connection to the omni can either be made directly through a ethernet cable or through ethernet cable to a usb converter into a computer. For programming the omni an API is included, which enables the connection to the omni. The Phantom omni has a lot of features which can be programmed through the language C++, where some of them are listed below
