\section{Geomagic touch}\label{sec:geo_magic}
The Geomagic Touch(GT) is a haptic feedback device, which has the ability to manipulate its joints in such a way that the user feels resistance when moving the pin in a certain direction or way. The Geomagic Touch described in this section can be seen on \figref{fig:phantom_omni}.

As mentioned the Geomagic Touch has the ability to generate resistance for the user. In other words, when moved in a specific direction it can create a counter force in respect to a certain position. On \figref{fig:phantom_omni}, it can be seen that the omni has six \gls{DOF}, where only the first three can be actuated, see \figref{fig:phantom1}. This means that the device only has the ability to generate force feedback with three \gls{DOF}.% in this case roll, pitch and yaw.

The connection to the GT is made through an UDP communication. This communication can be established directly through an ethernet cable or through an ethernet cable to a usb converter into a computer. The interfacing is shown on \figref{interface}. For programming the omni an API is included, which enables the connection to the GT. The GT has inbuilt features which can be programmed through the language C++, e.g force rendering or drawing graphics/position measurement. For this project the force rendering will be utilized for force feedback and the position for the GT as input to the system.
