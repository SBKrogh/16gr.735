\section{Overview}
\todor{This section has to be read}
As mentioned before, a fully featured DaVinci robot has four arms with 6-7 \gls{DOF} in total, when the Endowrist instrument included.
%Since the robot has 4 arms, there are 4 instruments.
%Although our setup controls only 4 motors, in funcionality it is equivalent to one DaVinci arm.
Although our setup controls only 4 motors, which gives the fully functionalities of manipulating one surgical tool.

The sbRio board controls the test setup and as such represents the onboard computer on the DaVinci robot.
In order to perform higher level functions such as force feedback control, it is necessary to remotely handle data and send high-level commands.
This is handled by an external computer system that is connected to the Geo magic touch device.

The sbRio board communicates with the computer using UDP communication protocols, while the Geomagic touch does so using TCP/IP.
The computer also performs force estimation using a dynamical model of the test setup (or Endowrist, more precisely), this is vital for force feedback.
In order to connect software components responsible for communicating with hardware and the ones responsible for the control algorithm and estimation.
For this purpose we use the Robot Operating System (ROS), which uses a network architecture to share data between components via data streams.
