\chapter{Communication}\label{cha:communication}

As mentioned in \secref{sec:introduction}, the force feedback loop should at least have a frequency of 600Hz. This loop not only includes the communication between the Geomagic Touch and the computer but also the communication between the sbRIO and the computer and the computation time required for force estimation. In the current setup, the bottleneck is the communication between the sbRIO and the computer as it can not exceed 100Hz. This chapter focuses on improving this communication to reach 1000Hz.
