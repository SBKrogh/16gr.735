\chapter{Communication}\label{cha:communication}

As mentioned in \secref{sec:introduction}, the force feedback loop should at least have a frequency of 600Hz. This loop not only includes the communication between the Geomagic Touch and the computer but also the communication between the sbRIO and the computer and the computation time required for force estimation.
