\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}

The communication protocol has significantly increased the refresh rate of the communication between the embedded system and the processing unit. This protocol includes a new format for exchanging data and modified the transport protocol used. However the desired refresh rate could not be reached.

The estimator derived dynamically corresponds to the variations in current and position. Although a delay is present in the feedback, the model is stable and can perform independently of the velocity of the human hand.

The friction model derived improves the accuracy of the feedback by reducing the force fed back at low current.
