  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The maximum communication frequency of 385 Hz did not reach the 550 Hz goal.
  	\item New encoding  decreased packet size by 85\%
  	\item Compression algorithms could further improve the communication frequency
  	\item UDP omits unnecessary retransmission
  	\item Emergency shutdown in case of communication error
  	\item Safety should be implemented against cyber attacks.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The EndoWrist's highly nonlinear nature made the modelling a challenge
		\item The imperfection of the data acquisition corrupts the models
		\item The models underestimate the force
		\item The grip force model has a delay of 0.2 s.
		\item The communication delay is negligible compared to the delay of the model
		\item The improvements caused by the Kalman filter proved to be minimal
	\end{itemize}
