% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow

% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features

\begin{abstract}
Haptic feedback is a form of transferring information to the user via the sense of touch, usually through some sort of input device the user gives commands with.
This makes it ideal for teleoperating tasks requiring precision in applied force, robotic surgery being a prime example.
Currently, haptic feedback in teleoperation is subject to numerous constraints on time delay and accuracy.
Nonetheless, results show that implementing this type of feedback in teleoperated robotic surgery gives vastly better results.
In this paper we propose a new method of teleoperating the DaVinci surgical robot using haptic feedback.
The method involves using a state-of-the-art haptic device to control a surgical tool serving as the robots end-effector.
Since the dynamics of the surgical tool are strongly non-linear, estimation techniques are used to calculate reaction forces on the device.
Changes are made to existing communication protocols in order to reduce time delay\todo{Maybe add results (operating frequency for example)}, which is an important factor.
The various constraints and challenges are adressed individually in each section. \todo{Erase last sentence}

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Over the last couple of decades the use of robots for minimally invasive surgeries has increased.
This is mainly due to its precision and the reduction in tissue damage\cite{RIGSP}.
Robots used in these surgical procedures have an attached end-effector that is used as a surgical tool.
One such tool is the Endowrist. 
The main advantage of the Endowrist lies in its construction, as it is made to be manipulated in a similar manner to a human wrist.

Currently the only feedback operators get is visual, using live video transmissions of the surgery. 
The problem with the operator having exclusively visual feedback lies in the fact that the surgeon has to estimate the force applied by the deformation of the skin and organs for each maneuver. %to skin and organs in every single manoeuvre made. 
It has been shown experimentally that haptic feedback has a considerably positive effect on the reduction in surgical error\cite{EOFGFF}. 

The purpose of haptic feedback is to apply force that resist the operators movement in such a way that it represents some information about the environment or situation.
In theory, this should make teleoperated surgical procedures a lot more realistic to the operator and thus reduce accidents.

The haptic feedback could be done as direct force feedback calculated from the resistance on the actuators but as the tool is highly non-linear the transparency of the controller will become less transparent\todo{transparent x2}.
It would be possible to solve this problem by implementing a sensor to the end effector to measure the force but due to the demand of high hygiene the tools have to be sterilized at temperatures over a $100^\circ$ C which could damage the sensor(s). Furthermore it is stated by law that each surgical tool has to be discarded after a few times in use\todo{after a few use}. This means that the cost of the tool has to stay as low as possible and therefore make the idea of implementing an expensive sensor not ideal.

Therefore the force feedback has to be estimated through the actuators which gives a high demand for the feedback controller as it has to be as precise as possible to feedback the correct force to the operator. Another important subject is the transparency of the feedback as the operator should have the feeling of doing the operation by hand and not remote\todo{remotely or through a robot}. This puts a demand on the speed of the feedback loop as the faster the loop runs the more smooth the force feedback to the operator will feel. This will set demands on communication frequency since we need to keep time delay to a minimum. It is wildly discussed what the minimum refresh rate of the feedback loop should be but seems to be someplace between 300 Hz and a\todo{remove "a"} 1000 Hz\cite{coles2011role}. 

In the section II we will take an overview of our proposed control system as a whole, briefly presenting each of the components and their interaction.
Section III will cover methods used to create a dynamic model of the Endowrist and proposed methods of translating the estimated force to actual force fed back to the operator.
Section IV contains descriptions of various problems pertaining the requirement of transparency and explanations of methods used to address them.
Finally,  we present (the expected) experimental results in section V and and draw a short conclusion in section VI.
 
 \section{System overview}
In out\todo{our?} proposed system, the surgeon uses the Geomagic Touch joystick to control an Endowrist tool on one of the arms of the DaVinci surgical robot.
It is important for the operator to have a feeling of resistance the tool is experiencing in order to adjust the position and grip strength and thus prevent damage to the patients tissue.
To achieve this, we use the Geomagics haptic feedback feature in order to project the reaction forces acting on the Endowrist to the operator. 
The communication between system components is done through the Robot Operating System (ROS).

\subsection{Endowrist}
An Endowrist, see \ref{fig:Endo_plates} \todo{figref?} is a surgical tool which can be manipulated as a human wrist. 
It is used in surgical procedures such as Laparoscopic surgeries, better known as minimally invasive surgery (MIS), where small incisions in the human body is made during the surgery. 
Because the incision cuts are small, blood lose\todo{blood loss?} during the surgery and the risk of infection is reduced. This has a positive effect on the recovery time for the patient.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.22\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Endowrist2.jpg}
		\caption{Actuator plates, which can alternate the end effector position}
		\label{fig:Endo_plates}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{.22\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Endowrist3.jpg}
		\caption{End effector of the Endowrist\newline}
		\label{fig:Endo_end}
	\end{subfigure}
\caption{The Endowrist and it's end-effector}
\label{fig:endowrits_set}
\end{figure}

As mentioned the Endowrist has the ability to be manipulated as a human wrist and thereby has four DOF, see \ref{fig:Endo_end}\todo{1b doesn't really show the 4DOF}\todo{figref}. This enables the movement of roll, pitch, yaw and an open closing mechanism that acts as the thumb and index finger of a hand. 

The end-effector is manipulated by the four wheels seen on \ref{fig:Endo_plates}. Wheel one and three define the movement of the yaw and the closing mechanism. Wheel two and four moves the pitch and roll. The Endowrist is cable driven, which enables the opportunity of making the Endowrist small but it also makes the system nonlinear as the force acting at one end is not directly transmitted to the other end due to friction. 

\subsection{Geomagic touch}
The geomagic touch is a haptic feedback device, which has the ability to manipulate its joints in such a way that the user feels resistance when moving the pen in a certain direction or way. 
The geomagic touch described in this section is the model Phantom omni and can be seen on \ref{fig:phantom_omni}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.22\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{haptick1.jpg}
		\caption{Overview of the Phantom omni's first three joints.}
		\label{fig:phantom1}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{.22\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{haptick2.png}
		\caption{Overview of the Phantom omni's last three joint}
		\label{fig:phantom2}
	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Overview of all the Phantom omni's joints\cite{phantom_omni}}
\label{fig:phantom_omni}
\end{figure}

As mentioned the Phantom omni has the ability to generate resistance for the user. In other words, when moved in a specific direction it can create a counter force in respect to a certain position. On \ref{fig:phantom_omni}, it can be seen that the omni has six DOF, where only the first three can be actuated, see \ref{fig:phantom1}. This means that the device only has the ability to generate force feedback with three DOF, in this case roll, pitch and yaw.

The connection to the omni can either be made directly through a ethernet cable or through ethernet cable to a usb converter into a computer. For programming the omni an API is included, which enables the connection to the omni. The Geomagic Touch has a lot of features which can be programmed through the language C++, e.g force rendering or drawing graphics.

\subsection{ROS} \todo{we should not describe what ROS is}
The ROS is an open source software development tool for implementing robotics software. It provides the opportunity of hardware abstraction, low level device control, implementation of commonly used functionalities, messages between different processes and package management.%{\cite{wiki_ros}}
 It provides tools and libraries which utilize the the opportunity of communicating between disturbed computers, obtaining, writing and running codes.
 
ROS has three different levels of concepts\cite{Wiki_ros_concepts}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The file system level}

Handles the main unit for a ROS system which is packages. A package may include data sets, ROS dependent libraries, configure files etc. to define a ROS process. In ROS a process is denoted as a node. 
\item \textbf{The computation graph level}

Handles the communication of the peer to peer network of the system in which data is processed. Through the computation graph level, the different nodes can communicate with each other by messages. When a node is sending data it is said to be publishing a topic. The different nodes can then subscribe to this topic to get the information that is published.
\item \textbf{The Community level}

ROS has a huge community which contain distribution of software installations, repositories and documentation of ROS. It also has a question and answer section with ROS related topics.
This community makes the process of learning the system considerably easier.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
As mentioned before , a fully featured DaVinci robot \todo{arm} has 7 degrees of freedom on the Endowrist instrument.
Since the robot has 4 arms, there are 4 instruments.
Although our setup controls only 4 motors, in funcionality it is equivalent to one DaVinci arm. \todo{I find this confusing}

\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{Test_setup4.jpg}
		\caption{Full view of the mechanical test setup}
		\label{fig:Mec_d}
\end{figure}

As mentioned before, the sbRio board controls the test setup and as such represents the onboard computer on the DaVinci robot.
In order to perform higher level functions such as force feedback control, it is necessary to remotely handle data and send high-level commands.
This is handled by an external computer system that is connected to the Phantom omni device.

The sbRio board communicates with the computer using UDP \todo{UDP is one of our results and not part of the initial setup} communication protocols, while the Geomagic Touch does so using TCP/IP.
The computer also performs force estimation using a dynamical model of the test setup (or Endowrist, more precisely), this is vital for force feedback.
In order to connect software components responsible for communicating with hardware and the ones responsible for the control algorithm and estimation.
For this purpose we use the Robot Operating System (ROS), which uses a network architecture to share data between components via data streams.

\end{figure}

\section{Force estimation}
In order to have a representation of the reaction force on the Endowrist, we must resort to estimation.
Because of the reasons mentioned in section II, we cannot measure it directly using sensors and thus have to rely on mathematical models as functions of torque measurements.

\subsection{Mathematical model}
The main challenge we face in making a model lies in the fact that the pulley system on the Endowrist is non-linear, and thus its full dynamics cannot be modeled in a simple manner.
Regardless, a physical model for grip force can be derived \cite{kim2014dynamic}, which serves as a good starting point for parameter estimation.
This model only calculates grip force, which we consider acceptable since it is the arguably the most important variable to feedback to the operator.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pulleys.pdf}
\caption{The pulley system of the Endowrist gripper modeled by equations (\ref{eq:dyn_1})-(\ref{eq:dyn_5}).}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}\label{eq:dyn_1}
J_m\ddot{{\theta}_m} + B_m \dot{{\theta}_m} + R_m T_{m1}(R_m {\theta}_m - R_1 {\theta}_1) = u_m
\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eq:dyn_2}
J_L\ddot{{\theta}_L} + B_L \dot{{\theta}_L} + R_L T_{L3}(R_L {\theta}_L - R_3 {\theta}_3) = u_L
\end{align}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:dyn_3}
J_1\ddot{{\theta}_1}+ B_1 \dot{{\theta}_1} + R_1 T_{12}(R_1{\theta_1} - R_1{\theta}_3 - R_2{\theta_2})\\ = R_1 T_m(R_m{\theta}_m - R_1{\theta}_1)
\end{multline}
\begin{align}\label{eq:dyn_4}
J_2\ddot{{\theta}_2}+ B_2 \dot{{\theta}_2} + LF = R_2 T_{12}(R_1{\theta_1} - R_1{\theta}_3 - R_2{\theta_2})
\end{align}
\begin{multline}\label{eq:dyn_5}
J_3\ddot{{\theta}_3}+ B_3 \dot{{\theta}_3} + R_1 T_{12}(R_1{\theta_1} - R_1{\theta}_3 - R_2{\theta_2})\\ = R_3 T_{L3}(R_L{\theta}_L - R_3{\theta}_3)
\end{multline}

\todo{we should include what each variable corresponds to (T, J, R, F, theta)}

From equations \ref{eq:dyn_1}-\ref{eq:dyn_5} it is visible that this system can be converted to a linear state space model.
Moreover, simplifying the equations by replacing physical coefficients with general ones results in a 10th order state space model with 31 parameters.
This is the model we will perform parameter identification on.

\subsection{Parameter identification}
Parameter identification is performed using the Matlab parameter identification toolbox.
For us to tune the model parameters, it is necessary for us to perform experiments for input-output measurement datasets.

We do this by applying a known force $F$ to the gripper and measuring efforts on the actuators.
The goal here is to get a fully parametrized state space model which we can then use for grip force estimation with a Kalman filter.

At the time of wiriting this article, we are stil in the process of developing a full setup for fitting the state space model.
As a working model we are currently using an linear approximation based on torque and output downwards force measurement.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
