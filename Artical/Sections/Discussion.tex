\section{Discussion}
Due to the structure of the Endowrist, we have split the dynamical model of the force into separate submodels pertaining to the actions most commonly performed.
A model was defined both for the grip force and outwards force of the clamping tool, leaving only the sidewards force generated by the roll actuator unmodeled.

The grip force models parameters are still to be defined through experiments performed using a load cell for grip force measurement.
Based on earlier results \cite{kim2014dynamic} we expect an approximation of grip force adequate for feedback.

For the outwards force, the linear model parameters are defined and we expect the model to be precise in action since it fits the experimental results well.
Additionally, it is simple to calculate so it doesn't introduce noticable delays in the system.

For usable information to be provided , the representations of feedback from these three models need to be independent of each other.
This means that the feedback force vector representing the yaw mechanism on the Geomagic Touch needs to be linearly independent from force vectors representing the other two mechanisms.
