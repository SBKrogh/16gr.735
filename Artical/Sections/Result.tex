\subsection{Communication}

The measurements of the communication's performance are gathered in \ref{tab:UDPMeasurements}. As the frequency increases, so does \todo{do?} the jitter and packet loss which was expected as these parameters are highly correlated to the network congestion\ref{cisco_jitter}. However when the frequency is set to its maximum functioning value, namely 638 Hz, the jitter sharply decreases while the packet loss increases. That phenomenon is due to the rejection of the packets that have a delay superior to 1 ms. In the driver a trade-off is made between the deadline set to receive a packet and the frequency of the communication. 
 % It was stated before that the requirements for our system was to get to at least 550 Hz and to reach 1000Hz if possible. As shown in Table \ref{tab:UDPMeasurements}, the connection can go up to almost 1000Hz using UDP which fulfills the requirements. However, the jitter should not be neglected as the frequency get closer to 1000Hz the jitter increases and becomes high compared to the period and may cause unexpected behavior in real time operation. It is though that as the period become smaller, the system becomes more sensitive to the preemption of other processes.

The goal of 1000 Hz could not be reached when running the entire system. However, as the original communication could not exceed the refresh rate of 100Hz a significant improvement is to be noted.
