\section{Conclusion}
A new communication protocol implementing UDP and transmitting bitcode has been designed to exchange data between the embedded system and the computer running ROS. It was shown through experiments that the new protocol provides an improved bandwidth without implementing new hardware. 

An action-based approach to output force modeling has been taken. 
We believe that this way force information is resented to the operator in a more useful manner than direct Cartesian force feedback.
Additionally, this approach simplifies calculation and avoids adding significant delays to the system.
