\section{Conclusion}

 Force feedback has been implemented using the data that can already be measured on a surgical robot. The refresh rate of the communication has been increased by reducing the size of the data sent and by implementing a new communication protocol. A model that estimates the force has been built. The system designed can be used as a basis for future implementation of force feedback on a surgical robot.
 
% A new communication protocol implementing UDP and transmitting bitcode has been designed to exchange data between the embedded system and the computer running ROS. It was shown through experiments that the new protocol provides an improved bandwidth without implementing new hardware. 

% An action-based approach to output force modeling has been taken. 
% We believe that this way force information is resented to the operator in a more useful manner than direct Cartesian force feedback.
% Additionally, this approach simplifies calculation and avoids adding significant delays to the system.
