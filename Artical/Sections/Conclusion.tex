\section{Conclusion}
A new communication protocol implementing UDP and transmitting bitcode has been designed to exchange data between the sbRIO and the computer running ROS. It was shown through experiments that the new protocol provides an improved bandwidth without implementing new hardware. 
\todo{add stuff about the model and the controller}

An action-based approach to output force modelling has been taken. 
We believe that this way force information is resented to the operator in a more useful manner than direct Cartesian force feedback.
Additionally , this approach simplifies calculation and avoids adding significat delays to the system.
