% Some advantages of robotic surgery are the precision and reduction e.g in tissue damage, thus reducing the recovery time\cite{RIGSP}.
Robots used in these surgical procedures have an attached end-effector that is used as a surgical tool.
One such tool is the EndoWrist.
The main advantage of the EndoWrist lies in its construction, as it is made to be manipulated in a similar manner to the operators wrist.

%Commonly the feedback received by the operator consists of visual cues in the video transmission of the surgery.
During surgery the operator receives feedback from the control loop. Commonly this feedback consists of visual cues in the video transmission of the surgery.
The problem with the operator having exclusively visual feedback lies in the fact that the surgeon has to estimate the force applied by observing the deformation of the skin and organs for each maneuver. \textcolor{green}{This constant effort from the operator not only increases the operation time but also leads to errors such as thread breaking during stitching or damaging tissues by applying too much force.} It has been shown experimentally that haptic feedback has a considerably positive effect on the reduction of surgical error\cite{EOFGFF}.

\textcolor{green}{The purpose of haptic feedback in Robotic MIS (RMIS) is to restore the sense of touch of the surgeon. One way of doing so is by applying forces on the controller of the surgeon that replicate the forces applied on the end-effector. This method is named force feedback and in an ideal case would give the same feeling as if directly holding a surgical tool. The direct force feedback calculates the feedback from the resistance affecting the actuators. However, as the tool is highly nonlinear, a significant part of the force applied to the controller of the operator corresponds to the nonlinearities. Any forces related to the construction of the robot are not desired in the feedback as the operator would not feel them when holding a tool. In order for the operator to feel as if he was directly holding the tool the control system should be transparent to him.}

The purpose of force feedback in Robotic MIS (RMIS) is to apply forces that resist the operatorâ€™s movements to match the external forces applied to the end-effector.
Force feedback gives the mechanosensory sensation of directly manipulating the end-effector, thus reducing the number of surgical errors.


The haptic feedback could be done as direct force feedback calculated from the resistance affecting the actuators, but as the tool is highly nonlinear, the transparency of the controller would suffer from it.}  It would be possible to solve this problem by implementing a sensor on the end-effector to measure the force, but due to the demand for high hygiene, the tools have to be sterilized at temperatures over a $100^\circ$ C which could damage the sensor(s). Furthermore it is stated by law that each surgical tool has to be discarded after a few use. This means that the cost of the tool has to stay as low as possible and therefore make the idea of implementing an expensive sensor(s) not ideal.

\textcolor{green}{Therefore the force feedback has to be estimated through the actuators, which requires a dynamic model of the tool. From this model the forces related to the actuation of the tool can be estimated and the external forces applied at the end-effector can be computed. Although, accuracy of the force feedback is extremely important for transparency, the response time and the frequency of the control loop also have to be considered as any of those could break transparency if too high. The frequency of the control loop is directly related to the frequency of the communication between the different components of the system. It is widely discussed what the minimum refresh rate of the feedback loop should be but seems to be someplace between 300 Hz and 1000 Hz depending of the hardness of the object\cite{coles2011role}.}

\textcolor{red}{Therefore the force feedback has to be estimated through the actuators, which gives a high performance demand for the feedback controller as it has to be as precise as possible to feedback the correct force to the operator. Another important subject is the transparency of the feedback, as the operator should have the feeling of doing the operation by hand and not remotely. This puts a demand on the speed of the feedback loop, as the faster the loop runs the smoother the force feedback to the operator will feel. This will set demands on communication frequency since we need to keep time delay to a minimum.
