\section{Communication}
The embedded system controls the motors for one Endowrist. The desired positions of the motors and the list of the enabled motors are sent to the board from the computer using an Ethernet cable\todo{Could you use other than Ethernet}. To perform force estimation, the computer needs to receive the \textcolor{green}{list of motors currently actuated}\textcolor{red}{list of the active motors} as well as the position, velocity and effort for each of them.

%{\color{green}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:introduction} the frequency aimed for the force feedback loop is 550 Hz. However this loop not only includes communication between the embedded system and the computer but also computation time for force estimation and communication between the GT and the computer. Thus, the communications with the computer must be faster than 550 Hz.
\textcolor{green}{The drivers for the GT have a refresh rate of 1000 Hz. From experimentation it was found that the embedded system's built-in UDP library cannot handle refresh rates higher than 1000 Hz. The resulting feedback loop then have a refresh rate of 500 Hz and not 550 Hz has it was aimed. This study aims at reaching the maximum frequency of the embedded system which is 1000 Hz.}

\textcolor{red}{The hardware available would not allow us to reach frequencies much higher than 1000 Hz\todo{Use the fact that the sbrio cannot go faster}, that is why 1 kHz was chosen as the aimed frequency for the communication with the embedded system. The drivers for the GT have a default frequency of 1kHz, this communication was not modified.}

% It is said that the minimum refresh rate of haptic feedback is widely debated to
% be between 300 Hz and 600 Hz, but for a realistic force feedback it is commonly accepted
% to be at least 1000 Hz\cite{coles2011role}. We decided to aim for 600Hz. In order for the system to fulfill this requirement it is necessary that the communication between the sbRIO board and the computer at least match this frequency.%\todo{which is not defined!}. %That is why this research aims at getting as close as possible to 1000 Hz in the communication between the sbRIO and the computer.
% }

The original system implements a stream of Javascript Object Notation (JSON)\cite{JSON_IETF} files using TCP. However this communication setup can not reach a frequency higher than 100 Hz, which does not match the goal of 1000 Hz. Thus, this section focuses on the modifications applied to the communication in order to make it reach the requirements.
 
In order to get a faster communication it was decided to use UDP instead of TCP as it does not retransmit any packets or implement any features to improve long distance communications. In our system, retransmission of packets would lead to retransmitting obsolete data instead of transmitting new ones. Furthermore, improvements of long distance communications would be superfluous since the two devices are directly connected.

In addition to the transport protocol, another factor that influence the speed of the communication is the size of the packets. To maximize the number of packets sent, the size of those packets must be minimized while keeping the computation time as low as possible. As stated before, the packets sent to the computer contain position, velocity, effort and a boolean value for each motor. The JSON used in the original system creates a human readable file and thus, use one character per digit in a number. In this setup the numbers can go up to 23 characters. The size of the numbers, combined to the additional characters required for the JSON leads to packets of 346 bytes in a worst case scenario, those packets are described in Fig. \ref{fig:old_packets}. To reduce the size of those packets, it was decided to interpret the binary representation as characters instead of the human readable format. As the numerical values are stored as floats following the IEEE 754 standard\cite{IEEE_754}, each of them require four bytes. Also, a constant structure was define to remove the need of control sequences. The new packets are described in Fig. \ref{fig:new_packets} and have a constant size of 49 bytes. Thus, the size of the packets was reduced by 86\%.

To investigate the quality of the communication as a function of frequency three parameters were measured: the delay between two packets received, the jitter and the error rate. Since the computation time for force estimation and on the embedded system are very small compared to the frequency of the communication, inferior to 3 $\mu$s, if the communication can reach the aimed frequency of 1kHz, the goal for the feedback loop is reached.

 In order to evalutate the performance of the new communication protocol between the embedded system and the computer, different frequencies were experimented. For each of them the delays between two received packets are measured and the from those measurements the jitter and packet loss can be computed.

% To investigate the quality of the communication as a function of frequency three parameters are measured: the round-time trip delay, the jitter and the error rate. However, as the software does not have a way of directly setting the frequency of the communication it is the delay in the communication loop that is modified through the experiment. The computation time and transmission time of the packets being non negligible, the frequency of the communication is not equal to the inverse of this delay.

%To decrease the size of the packets even further the packets could be compressed however for most algorithms the size reduction is small for this amount of data and thus not worth the computation time.\todo{should this sentence not be in the discussion?}
