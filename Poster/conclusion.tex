A new communication protocol implementing UDP and transmitting bitcode has been designed to speed up the data exchange between the embedded system and ROS, minimizing problems arising from delay, without implementing new hardware.

An action-based approach for output force estimation has been implemented, which performs better than direct force feedback.
 Additionally, this approach simplifies calculation and avoids adding significant delays to the system.
