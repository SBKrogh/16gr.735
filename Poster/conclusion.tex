 Force feedback has been implemented using the data that can already be measured on a surgical robot. The refresh rate of the communication has been increased by reducing the size of the data sent and by implementing a new communication protocol. A model that estimates the force has been built. The system designed can be used as a basis for future implementation of force feedback on a surgical robot.
