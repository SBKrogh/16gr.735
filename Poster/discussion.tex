When increasing the communication speed, increasing jitter and packet loss occur as these parameters are highly correlated to
the network congestion. %\cite{cisco_jitter}
The maximum refresh rate reached does not meet the generally accepted speed requirement of haptic devices \cite{coles2011role}, but the discontinuities occuring are practically impossible to notice.
To further increase the refresh rate, compression of the data
was considered and it is believed that implementing a fast
compression algorithm such as the one described in \cite{fast_ZIV} could reduce the time required to transmit a packet.
Due to the structure of the EndoWrist, we have split the
dynamical model of the force into separate submodels pertaining
to the actions most commonly performed.
