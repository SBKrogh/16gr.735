The surgeon controlling the currently commercially available da Vinci teleoperated surgical robot has to solely rely on a 3D visual feed when assessing the force output by the robot's end-effector. The lack of any kind of haptic feedback can lead to surgical accidents. The present project aims at implementing haptic feedback on the robot in order to reduce the number of surgical errors.
The original controller is substituted by a haptic device.

Challenges arise from the fact that the force affecting the end-effector cannot be measured directly, it needs to be estimated based on the measurable motor current. A position controller based implementation of the force feedback is analysed.
